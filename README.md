A neat game-of-life-style petri dish simulation I made back in 2016. 

Though it doesn't run very efficiently, it's great for relaxing and idly spacing out (when there is an outlet nearby).

Warning: this code is very old, from when I was first learning Java syntax. Needs a re-design to live up to any standards
